We hope you are enjoying the course, and have learned about the key concepts of protocols and layering! The materials for the second week are now available; make sure to look at the main course page for detailed notes. 

We expect many of you will find this week's lecture material more challenging than the first week because it delves into the communications techniques used in electrical engineering. But the reward is worth it: you will develop a good understanding of how messages are sent as signals over the links that you use every day, and you will have started learning about reliability, which is one of the central issues in networking. 

For those of you rusty on background (logarithms, binary arithmetic), there is excellent material on the course Wiki contributed by previous students. And, of course, many of your fellow students are willing to offer a helping hand. However, if this week's material is not to your liking then fear not: the beauty of protocol layering is that it hides the details of one layer from higher layers. This means that in future weeks we will not depend on the detailed operation of the physical layer, only the overall properties of the links that are constructed.
